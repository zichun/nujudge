Hi [[name]],Since the previous year, we have started manually tracking our students as a means to improve our alumni outreach and to facilitate job placements for these students. Last year, Ben and his team have developed a new online system, called Operis Impressions, to facilitate this tracking. This year, we have added the capability to track the performance of undergraduate teaching assistants as well. Please follow this [[link]] to access the Operis System and provide your comments on the students in the modules you taught this semester. You are not required to provide feedback on all the students. It would suffice to highlight only the outstanding students and the problematic students, if any. With appropriate feedback, the Department can better serve our students. The process should take no more than 10 mins of your time. Appreciate if you would complete your comments before the examiners' meeting.If you encounter any problem with the Operis system, please email operis@comp.nus.edu.sg for technical assistance.Thanks!Regards,[[sender_name]]
